        (Rich and creamy Sheer Khurma is an essential Eid dessert . This vermicelli dessert is mildly sweet aromatic,
        filled with lots of nuts, raisins and dates! Sheer Khurma is an essential for Eid. As far as I remember its been
        an Eid ritual in my home. My mum use to make it every Eid and I continued this
        tradition in my home. Eid festivities are incomplete without it. Having said that you can
        completely make it anytime of the year, without waiting for Eid.)
