            Ras malai consists of flattened balls of chhena soaked in malai (a type of clotted cream) flavoured with
            cardamom. Milk is boiled and a bit of vinegar or lime juice is added to split it. The whey is discarded and
            the milk solids are drained, cooled and kneaded into a dough.
