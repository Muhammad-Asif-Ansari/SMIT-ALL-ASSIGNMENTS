        Kashmiri Pink Tea or Kashmiri Chai (Gulabi Chai) is also known as Noon Chai in different places. It is noted
        that in the Kashmiri language, the word noon means salt as it is salty by default. Kashmiri tea or Sabz Chai has
        a little thick consistency and along with a buttery and creamy taste. However, it is also thin enough to take a
        gentle sip. Kashmiri tea’s origin is still unknown but it is believed to belong from the Himalayan areas of
        Pakistan, India, China, Nepal, and Bhutan. In Afghanistan, it is also called Sheer Chai or Shor Chai.
        Kashmiri tea (Gulabi Chai) has several benefits such as it is full of energy. It enhances mental alertness,
